**Enhancements**: These are a few things I've noticed while using the annotator view (which is pretty cool, btw).


- [ ] a **show/hide all** button for the annotations would be useful (and defaulted to 'show all' would be good)
- [ ] a **prevent overlap** checkbox, which would auto-correct shapes as you create them to not overlap existing shapes for other categories within the image (allows you to be a little more quick and sloppy with the drawing tools)
- [ ] **copy next/copy prev** (maybe next to the arrows in the upper right?) which would propagate the annotations from the current image to the next or previous image--this helps a lot when the images come from frames in a video sequence
